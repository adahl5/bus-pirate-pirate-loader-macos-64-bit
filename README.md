# macOS 64-bit pirate-loader for Bus Pirate
Precompiled binaries for pirate-loader that work on 64-bit macOS

Please note, I likely know the same or less about this compared to you. I'd appreciate not being blamed if your stuff breaks.

## Basic info

All I did was compile the code from https://github.com/BusPirate/Bus_Pirate

I haven't tested pirate-loader-v4 as I don't have v4 hardware

The binaries I came across were 32-bit and documentation in general was subpar

- pirate-loader-v3 is for Bus Pirate v3 (no way!)
- pirate-loader-v4 is for Bus Pirate v4 (how convenient!)


## Mildly useful links
- http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate_v4_and_pirate_loader_(only_firmware_updates)
- https://github.com/BusPirate/Bus_Pirate/blob/master/Documentation/building-and-flashing-firmware.md
- http://dangerousprototypes.com/blog/2010/09/03/bus-pirate-and-mac-osx-tutorial/
- http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate (you've probably been here)

Many of the links on these pages are broken, especially the ones that seem the most useful.

Hope this helps :)
