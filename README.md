# bus-pirate-pirate-loader-macos-64-bit
Precompiled binaries for pirate-loader that work on 64-bit macOS

Please note, I likely know the same or less about this compared to you. I'd appreciate not being blamed if your stuff breaks.

pirate-loader-v3 is for Bus Pirate v3 (no way!)
pirate-loader-v4 is for Bus Pirate v4 (how convenient!)

I haven't tested pirate-loader-v4 as I don't have v4 hardware
The binaries I came across were 32-bit and documentation in general was subpar

Mildly useful links

Many of the links on these pages are broken, especially the ones that seem the most useful.

Hope this helps :)
